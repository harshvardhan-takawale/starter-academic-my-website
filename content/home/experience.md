        Project 1: Proximity detection and verification of devices
        Designed a robust system aimed at verifying co-presence of two or multi-party systems using acoustic information and pair them using shared secret key. Achieved accuracy of $>$92\% across different scenarios when tested in noisy markets of India.
        
        Project 2: Landmark extraction from infrastructure for seamless indoor mobility
        Developed a human activity detection engine using mobile sensors data and WiFi AP to substantiate proof-of-attempt for multiple use-cases.
        
        Project 3: Inertial sensor based authentication systems
        Developed a human activity detection engine using mobile sensors data and WiFi AP to substantiate proof-of-attempt for multiple use-cases.
     
        Project 4: Tracking of gestures
        Developed a real-time syste to track human gestures done using mobile device and verify them with minimal false-positive rates. 
        
        All the projects are in line to be deployed with agreed customer companies as part of trials and filed as patents.

         Project: Malware Detection on Highly Imbalanced Data through Sequence Modeling(undergraduate thesis)
         
         Performed dynamic analysis on mobile application activity sequences for the purpose of malware detection on highly imbalanced dataset.
         Used the state-of-the-art language representation model BERT, to create a sequential model and achieved an F1 score of 0.919 with just 0.5\% of the examples being malware in the dataset.

        Project Title: Integrating Continuous Authentication into the Personal Health Record Applications

        Developed a protocol to authenticate users based on their interaction with the phone using anomaly in inertial sensor data.
        Analysed across 6 different classification models and achieved 95â€“97\% accuracy for each, when tested using tenfold cross validation.
