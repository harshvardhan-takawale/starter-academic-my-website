        Responsibilities include:
        Project 1: Proximity detection and verification of devices
        Designed a robust system aimed at verifying co-presence of two or multi-party systems using acoustic information and pair them using shared secret key. Achieved accuracy of $>$92\% across different scenarios when tested in noisy markets of India.
        
        Project 2: Landmark extraction from infrastructure for seamless indoor mobility
        Developed a human activity detection engine using mobile sensors data and WiFi AP to substantiate proof-of-attempt for multiple use-cases.
        
        Project 3: Inertial sensor based authentication systems
        Developed a human activity detection engine using mobile sensors data and WiFi AP to substantiate proof-of-attempt for multiple use-cases.
     
        Project 4: Tracking of gestures
        Developed a real-time syste to track human gestures done using mobile device and verify them with minimal false-positive rates. 
        
        All the projects are in line to be deployed with agreed customer companies as part of trials and filed as patents.
